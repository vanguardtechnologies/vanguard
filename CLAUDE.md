## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use `'use client'` only when necessary
- Follow Radix UI patterns for accessibility
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Ensure WCAG AAA contrast compliance
- Test all gradient backgrounds for visibility

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatCurrency.ts`)
- Pages: kebab-case folders (e.g., `market-intelligence/`)

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: production-ready code
- Feature branches: `feature/component-name`
- Commit format: `type: description` (feat, fix, docs, style)

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse score: 95+
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Time to Interactive: <3.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Windows (use Command Prompt, not PowerShell)
cd C:\Users\riz\Desktop\Vanguard\vanguard-web
npm run dev

# Or use the batch file
double-click start-dev.bat

# WSL
cd /mnt/c/Users/riz/Desktop/Vanguard/vanguard-web
npm run dev
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run db:seed      # Seed database with initial data
```

### Testing Email
```bash
# Emails are configured with Resend API
# Test emails go to delivered@resend.dev
# Production requires domain verification
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

### PowerShell Script Execution
If you get "scripts disabled" error in PowerShell:
1. Use Command Prompt instead, or
2. Run as Admin: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

### Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility
- Don't use `@apply` with custom properties
- No `tailwind.config.ts` needed
- Use standard CSS for complex styles

### WSL Network Access
- Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- If issues, check Windows Firewall settings
